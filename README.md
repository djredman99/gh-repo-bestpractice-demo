# Welcome to AWESOME PROJECT

AWESOME PROJECT is GDK (Graphics Development Kit) that provides core functionality to all of our Studio games and is responsible for the System I/O, Networking, and Licensing of those games.  All of our games will require the use of AWESOME PROJECT to successfully integrate to our custom hardware and backend services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running


### Usage

Explain how to use your project for various use cases or scenarios

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Setting up a development environment

### Using Codespaces
AWESOME PROJECT has defined a Codespace development environment that uses a custom Docker image and provides a ready to deploy, instantaneous, VS Code environent.  No configuration is necessary as it is all defined within the devcontainer.json file in this repository.  All you have to do to start development is create a new Codespace in this repository and start coding.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=624029587&machine=basicLinux32gb&location=EastUs)

### Setting up your own dev environment
In order to develop locally, you can still run the above Codespace from your local copy of VS Code or Visual Studio, or you can create the environment on your own machine.  To create your own environemnt you will want to:

1. Pick the development tool of your choice and install it on your machine.  AWESOME PROJECT can be developed with VS CODE or Visual Studio 2019 (and above)
2. Install the prerequisites as described above
3. Additionally, you will need to install
   - Tool A
   - Tool B

## Running Tests
