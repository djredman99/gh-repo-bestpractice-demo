# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# The `docs/*` pattern will override the global owners
# for the docs/ directory

# docs/*  @docs-team

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
# *.js    user@example.com @js-owner

# You can use the `*` wildcard to match any character in a path segment.
# For example, `octocat*` will match `octocat.png`, `octocat.gif`, etc.
# octocat*  @octocat
